# Project description

"Game Reviews" is a place where everyone can share their experience and opinion on their favorite games, whether by writing a full critique, or simply leaving a 1 out of 10 rating. The project utilises Angular version 13.3.2, it uses Firebase Auth for authentication, the data is stored in Firebase Realtime Database, and styled with NGBootstrap. It is deployed through Firebase Hosting.

## How it Works

You are greeted by the home page which features the highest/lowest rated games, latest releases, and most reviewed games. You can also browse the full catalogue and search for a specific game. The site is available to be viewed by anyone, but if you wish to leave a review then you must have an account. Authenticated users have a profile page where they can see all the reviews they've left, as well as a settings page where they can change their name, avatar, email or password. When leaving a review you can give it a rating of 1 to 10 stars, as well as optionally write a message with your impressions. You can also update or delete your own reviews. Admins can add new game entries to the catalogue, as well as delete and edit existing games information.
